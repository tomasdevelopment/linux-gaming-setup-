🎮 Linux Gaming & Streaming Setup

This repository contains my personal Linux gaming & streaming environment configs, scripts, and notes. It’s focused on Fedora + NVIDIA + OBS with tools like GameMode, MangoHud, and Proton.

I built this repo as both a guide for myself and others who want to squeeze the best performance from Linux while streaming or gaming.

🚀 Story & Motivation

When I first jumped into Linux gaming, I quickly realized it’s not as “plug & play” as on Windows. Drivers, OBS builds, Proton versions — all need tuning. But the reward is worth it: better customization, lighter resource use, and full control over my setup.

This repo documents my journey:

Fixing OBS crashes (switching from RPM to Flatpak builds).

Updating NVIDIA proprietary drivers with Fedora’s akmods.

Using GameMode for performance boosts.

Enabling MangoHud overlays for real-time stats.

Writing launch scripts that simplify things (e.g. gamemoderun mangohud %command%).

It’s both a reference for me and a blueprint for anyone who wants a stable Linux gaming/streaming rig.
